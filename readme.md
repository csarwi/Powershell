# PowerShell Profiles

Only `profile.ps1` is relevant — it is loaded by all PowerShell environments, including the VS Code PowerShell extension.
By default, VS Code uses a separate profile (`Microsoft.VSCode_profile.ps1`), but it will also run `profile.ps1`.
The same applies to normal PowerShell 5.1 — it also loads `profile.ps1` in addition to its host-specific profile.
